<p>Dear Kathryn Bennett,</p>
<p>I was excited to discover the Analyst in the Demography and Indigenous Statistics opening within Queensland Government Statistician’s Office (<strong>QLD/410641/22</strong>) for which I would make a strong candidate. In brief, I am quantitative sociologist and geographer specialising in social and spatial equity. I am also a rarity amongst researchers in that I have experience as a software developer where my roles was to develop data repositories, visualisations, and web applications for the Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network (AURIN), and am currently appointed at University of Queensland under the supervision of Dr Aude Bernard to collaborate with QGSO where I am developing workflows for analysing international and domestic migration using the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ Multi-Agency Data Integration Project (MADIP). As such, I already understand how to capitalise on this rich national data resource, which is an uncommon and highly sought-after expertise.</p>
<p>My capabilities in <em>governance</em>, <em>risk-management</em>, and <em>decisive</em> decision making were developed through project management roles including my PhD thesis that employed social surveys, crime incidence, remote imagery, administrative, and population census data for which I was awarded the University of Queensland (UQ) <em>Dean’s Award for Outstanding HDR Thesis</em> in 2020, and a current Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network (AURIN) High Impact Projects grant where I employ University of Queensland and Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology researchers to develop a national autonomous service that reveals car ownership over time and by postcode for analysing Australian transport disadvantage and the transition towards electric vehicles. I am highly-productive and <em>outcomes</em>-driven given that publication rate exceeds the career average of researchers in my fields with triple the career length (Pojani et al. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0739456X18804330">2018</a>; Coomes et al. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00330124.2012.697798">2014</a>), and my international research impact is ranked at the 99.83, 98.62, 97.52, 96.09, and 94.04 percentiles in “Greenspace; Green Infrastructure; Cultural Ecosystem Services”, “Crime Prevention; Policing; Environmental Design”, “Travel Behavior; Mode Choice; Urban Form”, “Geography”, and “Public, Environment, &amp; Occupation Health” (SciVal 3/12/21; InCites 3/12/21) respectively to name a few fields, which illustrates my capabilities to analyse a range of topics at the highest level. Further, this research quality and success highlights my capabilities to <em>gather insights</em> and <em>build enduring relationships</em> given that my research capitalises on secondary data collected by government agencies which requires continually developing new research relationships and arranging data sharing agreements. Likewise, my publishing illustrates my capabilities to <em>innovate</em> and develop <em>insights</em> given that peer-reviewed publications are required to be innovative and translatable into research, policy, and practice. Lastly, I am uncommon among researchers given I use rMarkdown both for scripting all my data harvesting, cleaning, geospatial and statistical analyses and for drafting manuscripts (including this <em>Cover Letter</em> and accompanying <em>Curriculum Vitae</em>), reports, presentation slides, and webpages so that I can <em>transparently</em> share my entire research pipeline with journals and online repositories (e.g., <a href="https://rpubs.com/AnthonyKimpton">https://rpubs.com/AnthonyKimpton</a>), and I containerise my R environment using Docker to ensure my analyses are reproducible, scalable, and translatable into interactive web-applications.</p>
<div class="page-break-after"></div>
<p>While this has not been requested, I feel it is also notable that I am familiar with many indigenous customs as my childhood home was in Meerschaum Vale near the Cabbage Tree Island community, my mother was nurse at Coraki Hospital next to the Box Ridge community, I attended school and volunteered at the Parks and Wildlife service alongside the Bundjalung people, and I was formerly employed by UQ’s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Unit to tutor first nations students. I am deeply committed to improving the lives of first nations people and so a position within your Demography and Indigenous Statistics unit represents an opportunity for a more direct role. In closing, I am confident in writing that I have an rare set analytical and technical capabilities, and life experiences that will ensure that I am an <em>effective</em> and <em>impactful</em> team member of QGSO.</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you in due course.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
