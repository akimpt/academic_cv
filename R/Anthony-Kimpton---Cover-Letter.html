<p>Dear Associate Professor Lane,</p>
</div>
<p>I am writing to apply for the position of <strong>lecturer in human geography</strong>, which was recommended by <strong>Professor Rebecca Wickes</strong> who was my PhD supervisor. Please see my included Curriculum Vitae and Selection Criteria Response. In brief, I am an early career researcher with a focus on how transport and land use spatial planning influence travel behaviour and community sociability. I was awarded a Univerity of Queensland <em>Dean’s Award for Outstanding HDR Thesis</em> in August 2020 for my PhD thesis that explores how community composition, the built environment, and particularly public greenspace and backyards impact the social sustainability of urban communities. Professor Rachel Armitage from the University of Huddersfield wrote in her review that it was a “…flawless thesis which contributes to the field in terms of theory, methodology and policy/practical application…” and Professor Alex Comber from the University of Leeds wrote in his that the: “…novelty of the thesis lies in the consideration of both public and private spaces…providing a strong theoretical development in this field”.</p>
<p>For research, I currently have a h-index of seven with 218 citations. My geographical and urban planning publications include three sole-authored Q1 publications, three lead-authored Q1 publications, a lead-authored Q1 monograph, a lead-authored peer-reviewed book chapter, and am a co-author on six further Q1 publications including one for a Springer Nature Journal (i.e., <a href="https://rdcu.be/ck1S0">https://rdcu.be/ck1S0</a>). My academic productivity exceeds the average human geographer from the United States or Canada with 6-15 career years who typically publish 1.4 articles and gain 13.8 cites annually, and I exceed the entire geography discipline that has 159.10 cites in total and a 5.7 h-index (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00330124.2012.697798">Coomes et al. 2013</a>). Likewise, my publication count already exceeds the Australian Level B urban planning median of 14, and citation count exceeds the Level C median of 167 (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0739456X18804330">Pojani et al. 2018</a>). Further, my normalised impact factor for “Greenspace; Green Infrastructure; Cultural Ecosystem Services” is 2.62 and at the 99.83 percentile, my “Crime Prevention; Policing; Environmental Design” is 2.99 and at the 97.52 percentile, and my “Travel Behavior; Mode Choice; Urban Form” is 2.44 and at the 98.62 percentile. You may have guessed from that these metrics that I am currently drafting a transport disadvantage DECRA application and if I were successful in this endeavour, it is my hope that USC could accommodate this research load. I was also recently awarded an AUD89,342 AURIN High Impact Projects grant to lead the design and development of the Green Australian Vehicle Ownership (<a href="https://aurin.org.au/about-aurin/network/aurin-high-impact-projects/">GreenAVO</a>) service that commenced at the start of 2022, and upon completion will reveal Australian spatio-temporal trends in vehicle ownership at the postcode-level, and so has capacity for tracking, predicting, and accelerating the national transition towards electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Regarding teaching, I have eight years of experience as I started tutoring prior to my PhD candidature, and developing and delivering lectures shortly after starting my PhD candidature and so I have an exceptional level of experience at my career stage. My most recent evaluations are 4.73 on a 5-point scale for tutoring, 4.5 for online and face-to-face lecturing, and the course evaluation rose from 4.1 to 4.3 for a class of 200 first-year geography and urban planning students.</p>
<p>Last, my academic service experience and research network is outstanding as I was invited and accepted the role of EMCR representative on the University of Queensland’s Science Faculty Research Committee. I am also a founding member of a large (i.e., 60+) interdisciplinary urban research network (UQ-HAUS) and have collaborated extensively with local and state government, and have published with academics from European, British, and North American research settings.</p>
<p>While my publications, funding, teaching, and service roles demonstrate an already upwards trajectory for an impactful research career, a lecturer position within the School of Social Sciences at Monash sets the foundations for an academic career and is the ideal setting given my interdisciplinary expertise. For instance, your school comprises Human Geographers, Sociologists and Criminologists while I have sole- and lead-authored Q1 publications within their disciplines in addition to urban planning and civil engineering. Further, my social sustainability research is a strong complement to the school’s <strong>urban sustainability transitions</strong> and <strong>human dimensions of biodiversity conservation</strong> research strengths, while my transport and land use research, and data science and software development expertise will expand the research domains within the school and open up new research avenues. As such, I can confirm that I have capacity for impactful collaborations within human geography discipline, throughout the School of Social Science, Department of Civil Engineering, and more broadly, and have established research ties at Monash, RMIT, and AURIN at the University of Melbourne.</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you in due course.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
